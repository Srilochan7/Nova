Create a mathematical animation showing the equation "E = mc²" appearing. Start with a clean black background, then have each part of the equation appear one by one: first "E", then "=", then "m", then "c", then "²". Each letter should appear with a smooth writing effect over 0.3 seconds. After the complete equation appears, add the text "Einstein's Mass-Energy Equivalence" in smaller white text below it. Make "E = mc²" in large yellow text, and have it glow briefly at the end. Total duration should be about 3 seconds.
