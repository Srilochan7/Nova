Use Manim to create an animation that visually demonstrates the concept of the derivative of a function.

Start by plotting the function f(x)=x 
2
  on a 2D coordinate plane.

Show a point P on the curve at x=2. Draw a secant line passing through P and another point Q, also on the curve, initially at x=4.

Display the formula for the slope of the secant line:  
Δx
Δy
​
 .

Animate the point Q moving along the curve towards P. As Q moves, show the secant line updating its position in real-time.

As Q merges with P, transform the secant line into the tangent line at point P.

Simultaneously, update the slope formula on the screen, changing  
Δx
Δy
​
  into the derivative notation  
dx
dy
​
  and show its calculated value at x=2.

Add a title above: 'Calculus: Visualizing the Derivative'.
